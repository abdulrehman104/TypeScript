# sfort Circuit

A short circuit in programming, including TypeScript, refers to a situation where the evaluation of a boolean expression stops as soon as the result can be determined without evaluating the entire expression. This behavior occurs when using logical AND (&&) or logical OR (||) operators.

In a logical AND operation, if the left operand is false, the entire expression will be false regardless of the value of the right operand, so there's no need to evaluate the right operand. Similarly, in a logical OR operation, if the left operand is true, the entire expression will be true regardless of the value of the right operand, so there's no need to evaluate the right operand.
