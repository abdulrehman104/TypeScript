# Objects

In programming, an object is a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on the data. Objects are instances of classes or prototypes and are used to model real-world entities and interactions in software.

# Interfaces

In the context of programming languages like TypeScript, interfaces define a contract for objects, specifying the structure they should adhere to. Interfaces typically declare properties and methods that must be implemented by objects that claim to conform to the interface. They enable type checking and help ensure consistency and compatibility across different parts of a codebase.

# Type Aliases

Type aliases allow developers to create custom names for types. They are particularly useful for simplifying complex type definitions or creating reusable types. Type aliases can represent a wide range of types, including primitive types, union types, intersection types, and object types. They provide a way to define custom types without introducing new entities into the type system.

# Math Objects

In JavaScript, the `Math` object is a built-in object that provides a collection of properties and methods for performing mathematical operations. It includes functions for basic arithmetic, trigonometry, logarithms, exponentiation, random number generation, and more. The `Math` object is not a constructor and cannot be instantiated. Instead, its properties and methods are accessed directly via the `Math` namespace.

# Structural Typing

Structural typing is a type system where type compatibility is based on the structure of objects rather than their explicit type declarations or inheritance hierarchy. If two objects have the same set of properties and methods, they are considered to be of the same type, even if they were not explicitly declared to be so. Structural typing is often associated with duck typing, where "if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck" applies. This approach allows for more flexible and dynamic type checking, particularly in languages like TypeScript and Python.
