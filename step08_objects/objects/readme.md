# Objects
In TypeScript, an "object" refers to a specific type that represents the collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or symbols) and values can be of any data type, including other objects. TypeScript provides robust support for objects through interfaces, object literals, and structural typing.

Here's a brief overview of how objects are used in TypeScript:

- **Object Literals**: You can create objects using object literal notation:

```typescript
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Anytown",
  },
};
```
