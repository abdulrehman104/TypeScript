# CLASSES:
- Class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects.
- It is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP).
- A class defines a data structure, along with methods or functions that operate on that data.
- Objects are instances of classes, and they encapsulate the properties and behaviors defined by the class.
