# READONLY:
The readonly modifier is used to indicate that a property of a class can only be assigned a value once, either in the property declaration or in the class constructor. After the initial assignment, the value cannot be changed.

# EXCLAMATION MARK (!):
We use the exclamation mark (!) to indicate that when we go ahead, we know that we will assign a value to it in this class. We are telling TypeScript that we are not initializing it right now, but we will definitely do it later in the code.
