In TypeScript, operators are used to perform operations on operands, such as variables, values, or expressions. Here are some common operators in TypeScript:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**:
   - `+` (Addition)
   - `-` (Subtraction)
   - `*` (Multiplication)
   - `/` (Division)
   - `%` (Modulus)
   - `++` (Increment)
   - `--` (Decrement)

2. **Assignment Operators**:
   - `=` (Assignment)
   - `+=` (Add and assign)
   - `-=` (Subtract and assign)
   - `*=` (Multiply and assign)
   - `/=` (Divide and assign)
   - `%=` (Modulus and assign)

3. **Comparison Operators**:
   - `==` (Equality)
   - `===` (Strict equality)
   - `!=` (Inequality)
   - `!==` (Strict inequality)
   - `>` (Greater than)
   - `<` (Less than)
   - `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
   - `<=` (Less than or equal to)

4. **Logical Operators**:
   - `&&` (Logical AND)
   - `||` (Logical OR)
   - `!` (Logical NOT)

5. **Bitwise Operators**:
   - `&` (Bitwise AND)
   - `|` (Bitwise OR)
   - `^` (Bitwise XOR)
   - `~` (Bitwise NOT)
   - `<<` (Left shift)
   - `>>` (Right shift)
   - `>>>` (Unsigned right shift)

6. **String Operators**:
   - `+` (Concatenation)

7. **Type Operators**:
   - `typeof` (Returns the data type of an operand)
   - `instanceof` (Checks if an object is an instance of a specific class)

8. **Ternary Operator**:
   - `? :` (Conditional operator)

9. **Nullish Coalescing Operator**:
   - `??` (Returns the right-hand operand when the left-hand operand is null or undefined)

These operators are used to manipulate data, control program flow, and perform various operations in TypeScript.
